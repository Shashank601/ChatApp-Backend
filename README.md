# ChatApp

Despite the name, this is not a fully developed or maintained chat application.

This repository is kept only for personal reference and learning documentation.  
The project does work, but parts of the UI were generated using ai during experimentation, so this is not something I claim as a fully self-crafted product.

The purpose of keeping this repository public is to preserve the learning process, architecture decisions, and implementation patterns explored while building it.

This repository exists solely for personal convenience. If you are looking for maintained or reusable code, look elsewhere.
